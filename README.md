## Mortgage Formula
The formula used to calculate the monthly mortgage payment (M) is:

```
M = P * [ r(1 + r)^n ] / [ (1 + r)^n – 1 ]
```

Where:
- **M** = monthly payment
- **P** = principal loan amount
- **r** = monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12)
- **n** = number of monthly payments (loan term in years × 12)
